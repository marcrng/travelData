### 4.1 |Identifying KPI's
After doing some quick research on common KPI's in travel management, I decided to track:

- Use of approved booking channels
- Use of approved forms of payment
- Realized negotiated savings
- Cabin compliance/non-compliance
- Traveler satisfaction
- Carbon visibility
- Booking tool adoption

### 4.2 |Data Collection
Having only 3 days to push the initial version of this project, I settled on a dataset from [Kaggle's 2019 Datathon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leomauro/argodatathon2019?select=flights.csv) rather than spending more time finding an API.

This dataset featured 3 tables: `flights`, `hotels`, and `users`. 

#### 4.2.1 |Data Creation
I wasn't satisfied with just the sample data found online, so I created some simulated data so tracking more of the above KPI's would be possible.
